    <h2>Business Model</h2>
    <p>The goal of Ashroh Enterprises is to build community, fight loneliness, and 
      help people form more authentic relationships. Initially this will be done 
      with community websites. The first website to be launched will be Queer 
      Toronto.</p>
    <p>From a business perspective, while there are several websites that list 
      some organizations and events for the LGBTQ (Queer) community in Toronto, 
      there isn't one that conveniently lists all of them in an easily filterable 
      manner. This will be Ashroh Enterprises initial value proposition for the 
      people who first visit each community website - it will be the only such 
      website to list all events and organizations affiliated with that community 
      in an easy to search, easy to filter manner.</p>
    <p>All events and organizations related to Queer Toronto will be listed on the 
      site. We won't charge just to list an event or organization. We will charge 
      for banner ads. Initially the primary revenue will come from these. There 
      will be an option to turn off the banner ads with a $7 per month fee. Paying 
      this fee will also make someone a customer-member of Ashroh Enterprises. As 
      described below, this company will be a triple-bottom-line customer/worker 
      co-operative. Initially no-one will pay the $7 per month fee and the bulk of 
      the revenues will come through banner ads. Eventually, however, more and more 
      people will move to the subscriber model. As discussed in the philosophy 
      section this will enable the company to optimize the experience and well-being 
      of the users of the site, instead of the advertisers, as is done in many other 
      social media companies.</p>
    <p>This company will be a triple-bottom-line, hybrid consumer/worker 
      cooperative.  Normally companies have written into their corporate charter 
      that they have a fiduciary duty to maximize shareholder profits above all 
      else - the bottom line.  This is why companies will harm the environment, 
      their workers, or the communities they operate in to make a buck - they have 
      a legal duty to do so - written in a legally binding contract between the 
      company and the shareholders.  This company, Ashroh Enterprises, will be 
      different.  It will have three bottom lines that will be balanced. One is to 
      maximize shareholder profit; one is to help the communities it operates in; 
      and one is to provide stewardship of the environment in its operations.  
      Furthermore, this company will be a partial co-op.  Three members of the 
      board of directors will be elected by employees to represent employees needs 
      there.  People will pay $7 / month to become a consumer-member of the 
      company.  When they do this they will get greater access to the site and also 
      the advertisements will be turned off, as discussed above. Also, they will be 
      able to vote on and run to be one of the three members of the board of 
      directors elected from the consumer-members.  Furthermore, the board of 
      directors will choose some decisions to be made by a vote of employees, some to 
      be made by the board of directors itself, and some to be made by a vote of 
      customer-members.  The privacy policy is an example of a matter that would be 
      decided by a vote of customer-members.</p>
