    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <h3>Thomas Brown, CEO</h3>
    <p>Thomas has a diverse set of experience and talents. He has studied physics, public administration, and 
      web development, winning numerous awards for academic excellence. His five years of experience in programming are largely
      physics-related. Additionally he has three years of experience working as a policy analyst for the 
      federal government, and four years providing data and technology support for the federal government.</p>
    <p>As someone who has personally battled with anxiety and depression, he understands that much of the increase in such
      diseases today is due to western industrialized society, in many respects, being a bad fit for the well-being of humans. He
      sees how even though we live in cities surrounded by other people all the time, we are increasingly alienated from each
      other and from nature. This imbues him with an intense drive and passion to help move society to one which is more 
      conducive to the well-being and health of humanity - one where people experience greater connection to each other and 
      to nature.

    <h3>David Yim, CTO</h3>
    <p>David is a highly intelligent individual who initially studied biology, obtaining a bachelor and masters degrees in 
      the field. He then studied as, and wrote the exam to become, a licensed pharmacist in Ontario. During these studies
      he did student work and then consulting work as a web developer. In so doing he found his true passion - developing 
      software applications. He has now worked full-time at York University as a web developer for three years, and is also 
      pursuing studies part-time to obtain his bachelor's degree in computer science.
    </p>
    <p>As a compassionate and caring person David empathizes with members of the LGBTQ population in Toronto when they
      are unable to easily find health care providers knowledgeable and sympathetic about LGBTQ issues, or feel isolated, 
      or disconnected from communities which they find important, such as religious ones. For this reason he has a strong
      desire to build tools, the Queer Toronto community web portal and the project Pink Book, which will 
      enable LGBTQ people of Toronto to locate sensitive and knowledgeable professionals, and to find connection with 
      communities.
