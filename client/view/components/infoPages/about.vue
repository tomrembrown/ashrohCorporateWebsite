    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <h3>Thomas Brown, CEO</h3>
    <p>I suffered from anxiety and depression most of my adult life. 
       Conventional treatments from Western medicine were not helpful 
       to me. I was told by a psychiatrist I had an incurable anxiety 
       disorder and would need weekly therapy and daily pharmaceuticals 
       for the rest of my life. After becoming dissatisfied with 
       conventional medicine, I sought out alternative treatments. One 
       of these, an alternative shamanic treatment from the Amazon 
       jungle, was so helpful it cured 95% of my anxiety and depression. 
       I now perceive anxiety and depression to be healthy reactions to 
       a sick society. Our society is fundamentally sick and broken. My 
       mission in life is to help heal our society. Ashroh Enterprises 
       is the first step in doing this. This company will rebuild our 
       lost communities and combat the loneliness epidemic in our 
       society.

    <p>I have completed the Entrepreneurship 101 course at MaRS, 
      during which I interviewed half a dozen potential customers, 
      and created a lean business model canvas. Also, I am currently 
      building the MVP (minimum viable product) which will be a 
      community web portal for the LGBTQ community in Toronto. This 
      will initially just list organizations and a calendar of events 
      for Queer Toronto, as well as a 'pink book', a list of health 
      care professionals knowledgeable about and sensitive to LGBTQ 
      issues. In my research I discovered that there are other 
      websites that list some organizations and events for Queer 
      Toronto, but there isn't a single website that conveniently 
      lists all of them.
    </p>
    <p>I am building the Queer Toronto web portal with vue.js, SCSS, 
      ES2017, webpack, node.js, express, boostrap 4, and a PostgreSQL 
      11 database. I have taked or am currently taking courses on 
      Udemy about all these technologies.
