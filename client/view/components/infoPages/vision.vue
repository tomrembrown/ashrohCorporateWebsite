    <h2>Vision of Ashroh Enterprises</h2>
    <p>
      More and more people are awakening to the fact that our society is broken. 
      Instead of acting as though all is one, we are separated from each other and 
      from our natural environment.  Many of our relationships are lacking in 
      authenticity. A sense of community has eroded from society. Even though most 
      of us live in cities surrounded by other people, loneliness has increased to 
      the point where it is considered by many to be an epidemic disease. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The vision, the why, of this company, Ashroh Enterprises, is to fight the 
      loneliness epidemic by helping people build more authentic relationships, 
      those with people they see face to face on a regular basis who they can be 
      their true selves around. This company will foster relationships that are open, 
      honest, authentic, and sincere. Ashroh Enterprises exists to help people build 
      true community. 
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many ways to build community and fight loneliness. To begin with, we are 
      focussing on building community web portals, starting with the Toronto LGBTQ+ 
      population (“Queer Toronto”).  Queer Toronto will initially consist of a list 
      of organizations, calendar of events, as well as Project Pink Book; a list of 
      professionals and businesses who are LGBTQ+ allies. There are other websites 
      that list some LGBTQ+ organizations and events in Toronto, but no websites provide a 
      comprehensive list.
