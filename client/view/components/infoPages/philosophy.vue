    <h2>Company Philosophy</h2>

    <p>It may be paradoxical to create a company that largely uses the World Wide 
      Web to combat a problem largely created by the World Wide Web; loneliness.  
      Perhaps, however, this is simply a realization that the Internet or Web is a 
      technology, and like all technologies by itself it is neither good nor bad, but can have 
      more positive or more negative impacts depending on how we use it.  Nuclear 
      energy can be used to power our cities, homes and factories, or it can be used 
      to destroy.  Cars can be great transportation devices, but if not managed 
      properly they can lead to serious environmental problems.</p>

    <p>The Internet has the potential to allow people around the world to 
      understand each other better, to access information at their fingertips that 
      would previously have been extremely difficult to find, to bring people 
      together, to help identify and solve our social problems, and to allow us to be 
      more authentic with each other.  It also has the potential to allow fake media 
      stories to circulate, to allow totalitarian states greater ability to monitor 
      and control their populations, to separate people, to present people with only 
      views they already agree with and thereby accentuate the differences between 
      groups.  It has the potential to turn people into commodities where their 
      personal information is collected and sold to the highest bidder in order for 
      heavily targetted ads to be presented.  It has the potential to help people be 
      more productive by allowing them to access greater stores of information, or to 
      be less productive, by fragmenting their attention and lowering their ability 
      to concentrate.  It has the ability to foster friendships by allowing people to 
      find those who share similar interests to themselves to participate in 
      activities together, or indeed by helping them understand those with different 
      interests better.  It also has the ability to foster separation by creating the 
      illusion of togetherness through purely virtual friendships. In short, it can
      have both positive and negative effects depending on how we use it and how the 
      web and mobile applications are built.</p>

    <p>T.S. Eliot said of the television, "It is a medium of entertainment 
      which permits millions of people to listen to the same joke at the same time, 
      and yet remain lonesome."  This has been exasperated by the Internet.  Why has 
      this happened?  Is there a way to use the Internet to encourage people to 
      go out and meet each other face to face again? Can it be a tool to increase social
      connection, not decrease it?</p>

    <p>The World Wide Web is a fairly young technology, being first developed by Tim 
      Berners-Lee in 1993, making it only 25 years old.  We have greatly solved 
      many of the technological problems it faced, but we are only now starting 
      to understand and address the social impact of the World Wide Web.  Perhaps it is now time to 
      investigate how to minimize the negative social potential of the Web and bring 
      out its positive social potential.</p>

    <p>The Internet has the potential to be the most democratizing technology ever 
      invented.  People from around the world can discuss what the major problems the world is
      facing and how to fix them.  It can help people from different 
      places and different cultures, different backgrounds and different languages 
      understand each other.  It can highlight problems that have been kept in the 
      dark.  It can also help bring people together.  Potenially it could also help form 
      true communities.</p>

    <p>It is taking a fairly dark path in many ways, however.  People are 
      encouraged to share as much of their personal information as possible on social 
      networking sites and then that information is analyzed to determine very 
      detailed personality and other information about the individual which is then sold 
      to the highest bidder.</p>

    <p>Part of the reason websites like Facebook have not previously been able to 
      optimize the social impact on their users is that their users are not their 
      customers. Facebook's customers are advertisers. Facebook may say on its front 
      page that it is free and will always be free. This is not true, however. The 
      users may not pay in the form of a subscription fee, but they pay in another 
      way. Specifically the entire website is built to optimize the data collection 
      and advertising needs of Facebook's real customers. It is designed to keep 
      people on the website, gather as much data as possible about them, give them 
      highly targetted advertisements; all to further the goal of optimizing the 
      results for its true customers, the advertisers.</p>

    <p>Could we have a co-operative Internet company?  One where all its customers 
      are members and they vote on what private information to share and to whom?  
      Can we bring in secure e-voting to allow all members to democratically vote on 
      motions?  Ashroh Enterprises endeavours to be such a company.  As discussed in the 
      business section of this website, while initially generating revenue from 
      advertisements, Ashroh will eventually move to a subscription business model, where the 
      users of the website are its customers. It will then be in a position to optimize its
      social impact on its customers and members, the users of its websites.</p>
