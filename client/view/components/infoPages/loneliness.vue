    <h2>Loneliness in Modern Society</h2>
    <p>Many people are discussing the increase in loneliness and its detrimental effects in modern society. There have
      been several surveys done indicating that loneliness has increased in recent decades, and demonstrating its
      negative effects. The paragraphs below discuss some of this research.

      In an article written in Havard Business Review by the former Surgeon General of the United States, Vice Admiral 
      Vivek H. Murthy writes that during his years caring for patients the most common pathology he saw was loneliness.  
      He cites statistics that 40% of adults in America report feeling lonely and that "[l]oneliness and weak social 
      connections are associated with a reduction in lifespan similar to that caused by smoking 15 cigarettes a day".  
      Furthermore, "[l]oneliness is also associated with a greater risk of cardiovascular disease, dementia, depression, 
      and anxiety."

      According to a study commissioned in the UK, 48% of adults feel varying degrees of loneliness.  Curiously the 
      loneliest place in the UK is its biggest city, London.  One in five people report feeling more lonely now than
      they were 10 years ago.  18 to 24 year olds experience loneliness as much as people in their sixties.  People in 
      their 30s, 40s, and 50s, however, are less likely to experience loneliness.

      In the United Kingdom an MP, Jo Cox, who campaigned on loneliness was murdered by a right-wing extremist.  In 
      response the government commissioned a study on loneliness, and based on this study appointed a minister of 
      loneliness.  The MP in charge of this study, Rachel Reeves, notes a decline in social institutions that once 
      connected people, and that more people are now living alone and more people are working from home.  Also, she 
      advocates a new type of welfare system that brings people together to help them help each other.

      Baya Voce in her TED talk at Salt Lake city in September 2016, titled 'The Simple Cure for Loneliness' calls 
      loneliness a public health crisis.  She states that communities around the world where people live the longest, 
      happiest lives are those where people spend the most time together - whether they are praying together, or 
      walking together, or doing some other activity together.  These communities prioritize on connection and focus 
      in their relationships.  The most powerful tool for connection is ritual, which is repeated action plus 
      intention.  She recommends creating rituals with loved ones and friends, such as spending Monday nights together 
      talking.  She describes how ritual acts as your anchor of connection.

      John Cacioppo in a TED talk called 'the lethality of loneliness' at Des Moines discusses how our part of our 
      evolutionary advantage is our ability to plan, communicate and work together.  Loneliness is part of a 
      biological machinery to alert one to threats to one's social structure.  In 1980 20% of Americans feel lonely 
      at any given time.  Thirty years later this has doubled to 40% of Americans feeling lonely at any given time.  
      Loneliness is stigmatized.  Admitting to feeling it can make one appear weak. Living with air pollution 
      increases your odds by 5%, obesity by 20%, while living with loneliness increases your odds of early death by 
      45%.  This is true in other species too.  The brains of social species have evolved to respond to being on the 
      social perimeter by going into self-preservation mode.  The lonelier the brain, the less the activation of 
      empathic parts of the brain in brain studies, since people on the social perimeter are focussed on 
      self-preservation, not the well-being of others.  Much of what is triggered by social isolation is 
      non-conscious.  Loneliness creates a hypervigilant state, increases defensiveness and depressive symptoms and also
      increases morning cortisol levels in preparation for a dangerous day as well as decreasing the quality of sleep.  
      Social networking does not replace comfort of a friend. According to John Cacioppo, What matters is not the 
      quantity of friends, but the quality of a few relationships.
